# Collection of my custom themes and stuff.
![icons in Debian-openbox](/scrot1.png)

## Instructions:


* Papirus mod:

This is modified version of Papirus with brand new system tray icons, Folder icons and some other recolored icons.
To use it, you need to replace your Papirus(or Papirus dark or light) dir with my Papirus dir and overwrite all the icons.Therefore the original Papirus should already be present to patch it.
(in ~/.icons or /usr/share/icons/). Relog in your session to completely apply all the icons.

* Tint2 theme:

This is a custom made tint2 theme with brand new icons for some applications. Paste the tint2 dir in ~/.config/ and select the theme with your tint2 gui editor/ theme selector. Do not forget to put the correct path of the icons in your tint2rc otherwise the icons wont appear(change it to your username in /home/USERNAME/.config/tint2/icons/icon.png).

* Openbox theme:

This is a modified version of the Yeti theme which comes with Bunsenlabs with new icons. Paste the Yeti-Pix dir in ~/.themes/ to use it and select the theme with your Openbox Configuration Manager.

That's it. Enjoy.
